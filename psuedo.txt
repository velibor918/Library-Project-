have array
have constructor
have way to add books to array 
have way to create dom elements and associate them with book
have function that toggles books read state
have way to remove books from array


let library = []

constructor Book (title name author pgnumber read) Also add unique id, without it being in parameters
    read should be true or false value
    have function that can check and change read value  
        dependent on this value, toggle read status text content and inform user of read state


make function that toggles books read state
put it on Book prototype
append it to button in DOM before pushing the DOM to the DIV

function readState 
    if this.read = true
            this.read = false
            the read p.textContent = Not read
    else this.read = true
            the read p.textContent = Read
IMPORTANT READ P MUST HAVE CLASS ADDED IN CREATEDIV FUNCTION SO IT CAN BE ACCESSED

add pop up form that adds books to library array
    form would have basic structure, submit button would have funcion 
        function would take form values as params and put them in constructor
        function also has prevent default to avoid issues
            function form 
                let book = new Book (form.values)
                        this DOM create function will be seperate function that will be called with book param
                        this function will be on Book contstructor as prototype
                        function createDiv(book)
                            const value = document.createElement(div)
                            here add check for read value
                            based on value give the specific p the required text content
                            value.appendChild(document.createElement(p).textContent = book.value)
                            value.setAttribute(data-attribute book.id)
                            value.appendChild(document.createElement(button).addEventListener(read status function))
                            parentdiv /the one that holds all the books dom cards/ .appendChild(value)
                library.push(book)

have basic layout with div where new books will be stored 
after new book is created from form, when it is pushed, create a div for it and push it to the parent div

make function that removes books from array 
function remove books 
    let value = library.indexOf(this.id)
    array.splice(value, 1)
    let value2 
        for loop 
            find DOM with corresponding data attribute and put it in a value
        parentDiv.removeChild(value of data attribute)
